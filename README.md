## What is dithering, and why is it useful?
[Dithering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dither) (in the context of digital images) is the process of intentionally applying noise to randomize [quantization error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantization_(signal_processing)) and is useful in preventing [color banding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colour_banding) in an image. This effect is commonly used in systems with a limited [color palette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palette_(computing)), and can create the illusion of [color depth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_depth) due to the way the human eye perceives color.
