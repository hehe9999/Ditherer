# A fork of [MOPHEADART's Python-based ditherer](https://github.com/MOPHEADART/Ditherer)

## What is dithering, and why is it useful?
[Dithering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dither) (in the context of digital images) is the process of intentionally applying noise to randomize [quantization error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantization_(signal_processing)) and is useful in preventing [color banding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colour_banding) in an image. This effect is commonly used in systems with a limited [color palette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palette_(computing)), and can create the illusion of [color depth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_depth) due to the way the human eye perceives color.

## What is this project?
This project is a Python-based dithering tool that can be used on a variety of media formats, including images and videos. It is designed to be easy to use and fun to play around with, and it is also a great way to learn about dithering, its uses, and how it works. My main goals with this project are to make something that is user-friendly, fun, and educational. This is also a tool for me to learn about Python, image and video manipulation, and to spend my free time in a fun and rewarding way. If you have any suggestions or feedback, please feel free to reach out!

## Usage
To get started, download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/hehe9999/Ditherer/releases). Once you have downloaded the latest release, extract it to a folder of your choice, then open the 'Ditherer.exe' file. Once inside the program, you can import media files at the top, then select a dithering algorithm from the drop-down menu. From here, you can play around with the options for your selected algorithm and then click the export button at the bottom to save your file.

The current supported formats are:
| Media Type | Supported Formats     |
|------------|------------------------|
| Video*      | `.mkv`, `.mp4`, `.webm` |
| Image      | `.png`, `.jpeg`, `.jpg` |

* For video files, you will need to install [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/), I recommend using [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) to do this. You can do this by running `choco install ffmpeg` in your command prompt after chocolatey is installed.
